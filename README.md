# SHOMN-Project---NASA-Space-Apps-Challenge-2019
Matlab Simulink Modeling for electricity production using piezoelectric-based Floor Tiles.
In order to reduce #GLOBAL #WARMING causing risks on the climate and the environment in general, Us, #Shomn team, thought of another method to create electrical energy as #GREEN #POWER to reduce polluting electricity resource used by the industry at the first place. 
This model simulate our proposed prototype for the suggested solution.
